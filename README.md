We tried to apply apply different neural network architectures for tackling the problem of
sentiment analysis [classify whether a movie review is positive or negative] of the IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews[http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/]

Steps:
  1. Apply appropriate preprocessing steps, and splitting the dataset in training, validation, and testing sets.
  2. Develop RNN and CNN models using Glove embeddings or not
  3. Develop a BERT pretrained model from Hugging Face https://huggingface.co and fine-tune it on the IMDB Dataset
